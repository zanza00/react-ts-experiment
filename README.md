## Innovations

### - RAPID-SPEED DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW - no bundling!
No bundling during development, instead loading source files (.ts/.tsx) directly in the browser (using [plugin-typescript](https://github.com/frankwallis/plugin-typescript)).  
When file changes - skipping type-checking (which is delegated to seperate process) and reloading only the changed file with hot-reload

### - DELEGATED TYPE-CHECKING
Type-checking is delegated to a seperate process using following options:
- __CLI__ - TSC compiler process running in watch mode: [instruction here](#cli-workflow)  
- __Editor/IDE__ - use internal TypeScript Language Service (e.g. Webstorm, VS Code, Atom, Sublime Text, alm.tools and more...)

__NOTE:__ There are two seperate __tsconfig__ - one for type-checking during development and other for source-code transpilation to create production bundle:

[tsconfig for type-checking during development](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-starter-kit/blob/a00c1b5854c36ea4d31fa1255ce920134bfc3855/src/tsconfig.json)

[tsconfig for building production bundle](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-starter-kit/blob/a00c1b5854c36ea4d31fa1255ce920134bfc3855/jspm.config.js#L129)

### - STRICT NULL CHECKS - Enabled
Enabled strictNullChecks with noImplicitAny tsc flags, to increase type safety and grant better tooling support using Non-nullable Types (v2.0) and Smarter Type Inference (v2.1) [Source](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/typescript/2016/11/08/typescript-2-1-rc-better-inference-async-functions-and-more/)

### - HOT-RELOAD THAT SCALE
Local dev server with hot-reloading out-of-the-box (using [systemjs-hot-reloader](https://github.com/capaj/systemjs-hot-reloader)).  
__How:__ Loading each module separately and using SystemJS module registry, on changes it's removing old module from registry and re-importing updated one then re-evaluating only those modules that was importing the changed module  

__Great scaling capability with increasing module count because you reload single module files that has changed without rebuilding anything.__
> __Differences with Webpack workflow explained__ from real project perspective by [@jonaskello](https://github.com/jonaskello)  https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1564#issuecomment-252903932

### - CLI WORKFLOW
Most often your team is using different Editors/IDE's so you'll need to have a common way to run type-checking using a specific version of TypeScript compiler for consistent results and avoid Editor specific issues.  
Run `tsc -p src --watch` command for quick incremental type-checking or `tsc -p src` command for one-time complete check (JS emit is disabled to not clutter your project with intermediate JS files)

### - ASYNC/AWAIT/GENERATORS transformation when targeting ES5 (No Babel)
Support for "async & generator functions" when targeting ES5 __without Babel!__  
- Async/Await - TypeScript v2.1 provide native support for ES5 transformation (https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/9175)  
- Generators - generators downlevel transformation (to ES5) is a work in progress ([Source](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/12346)
also [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/3975) and [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1564))

__Until then use an alternative solution covered below:__

[Facebook Regenerator Project](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator) instead of __Babel__ to transform Generator Functions. _(NOTE: Internally **Babel** is also running "regenerator runtime" for async and generator functions transformations - https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/caveats/)_

> When building for production use `npm run regenerator` command after completion of build step, this will run "regenerator" on app.js bundle. Alternatively use `npm run build:regenerator` command to automatically run "regenerator" with each production build

### - TESTING WITH TYPESCRIPT
- Writing and running tests in TypeScript runtime using source files, abstracting complicated setups and transpilation complexity (use `npm test` CLI command)
- Test harness using [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

### - CSS-MODULES WITH TYPED CLASS-NAMES EXPERIMENT
Locally scoped CSS styles, encapsulated as ES6 Modules that can be imported in UI components, with capability to type-check CSS class-names in your components using interfaces and leverage TypeScript IntelliSense features in Editor/IDE (using [csjs](https://github.com/rtsao/csjs#faq)):  
- Define available CSS classes as interfaces in CSS-Modules to get className property auto-completion, type-checking and easy refactoring in your entire codebase.  
- Auto-generate documentation for CSS styles leveraging JSDoc support in defined interfaces.  
- Full CSS support - including pseudo classes, media queries & more...

__EXAMPLE:__ [Consumer Component](src/containers/css-modules-container/index.tsx) and it's [CSS Module Styles in TypeScript Format with Class-Names Interface](src/containers/css-modules-container/container-styles.tsx)  
__DEMO:__ http://piotrwitek.github.io/react-redux-typescript-starter-kit/#/css-modules

### - Optimized JSPM (SystemJS) loading speed
To speed up a full page reload by minimizing request count it is possible to create a development "vendor bundle" for external dependencies loaded from node_modules.  
If not leveraging HTTP/2, it is a best practice to bundle all external dependencies together and load as a one bundle

Test reload speed improvement using this simple test procedure:  
1. run `npm run unbundle` -> open network tab in chrome dev tools -> reload the page -> check logged results  
2. run `npm run build:dev` -> open network tab in chrome dev tools -> reload page -> compare logged results with previous

## Features

- PRODUCTION-WORKFLOW - cross-platform npm scripts for production bundling & deployment, github-hooks, linter, test runner etc.
- TYPESAFE-API-CALLS - type checking contracts of REST API calls - forget constantly checking for API docs and let your IDE guide you
- REACT-ROUTER - included `react-router-redux` to store your routing in state for Time-Travel capabilities
- REDUX-DEV-TOOLS - installed Redux DevTools capabilities with [chrome-extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
- IMMUTABLE-STORE - using `seamless-immutable` for simplicity and backwards-compatibility with vanilla JS (no hassle with `toJS()`, `get()`, `getIn()` in your containers and components)
- BEM & ITCSS - using BEM with Inverted Triangle conventions to give meaning and context to CSS classes

#### React Best Practices & Optimizations
- no mixins -> use ES6 style PureRenderMixin with PureComponent
- no ref strings -> use ref callbacks
- no method binding -> use ES Class Fields
- no function/objects instantiation in render method -> instantiate in outer scope and use references
- render big collections in separate, dedicated components -> no unfortunate re-renders when other props changes
- don't use array index as key property -> use item unique id property to eliminate bugs
- remove `bindActionCreators` boilerplate using object literal with actions instead of `mapDispatchToProps` function [issue #32](/../../issues/32)

#### React-Redux Patterns
- Flux Standard Actions for Redux - https://github.com/acdlite/redux-actions
- Redux Reducer Modules - https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux

#### JSPM / System.js / Rollup

- JSPM 0.17.X - production ready set-up with best-practices from real-world projects
- optimized loading speed by utilizing `vendor` dev-bundle (read below)
- using Rollup for bundling and tree-shaking optimizations
- bundles for production - seperate vendor & app bundles
- importing and bundling CSS / SCSS / JSON / Image files using plugins

## Workflows Guide
__NOTE: Use index.prod.html for production, it have slightly different loading logic. Add references to your static assets like links/scripts and copy to the dist folder during a build process.__

#### Development Workflow
1. `npm run build:dev` - create bundle of vendor packages to speed-up full-page reload during development _(re-run only when project dependencies has changed)_
2. `npm start` - browser will open automatically

#### NO-IDE Workflow - command line type checking
1. `npm run tsc:watch` - if you don't use IDE with typescript integration, run tsc compiler in watch mode for fast incremental type-checking (NOTE: this will not emit any JS files, only type-checking - it's OK because you load ts file on-the-fly)
2. `npm run tsc` - one-time project wide type-safety check

#### Build for Production Workflow
1. `npm run build` - create app.js & vendor.js bundles in 'dist' folder
  - `npm run build:app` - build only app.js bundle _(run when project source code has changed)_
  - `npm run build:vendor` - build only vendor.js bundle _(run when project dependencies has changed)_
2. open `http://localhost/dist/` - check prod build on local server
3. `npm run regenerator` - if you want to add "async/generator functions" downlevel transformation - use when targeting ES3/ES5

`npm run build:dev` - build vendor packages into vendor.dev.js bundle to speed-up full-page reload during development - non-minified with source-maps (dev bundle)

`npm run unbundle` - delete vendor.dev.js bundle package __(WARNING: it will result in loading all of vendor packages as seperate requests - use it only if you know what you are doing e.g. when leveraging HTTP/2 multiplexing/pipelining)__

#### Production Bundling (`dist/` folder)

`npm run build` - build both app.js & vendor.js bundle for production

`npm run build:app` - build app source code into app.js (prod bundle) - minified, no source-maps

`npm run build:regenerator` - alias to run both `npm run build:app` and `npm run regenerator`.

#### Deployment

`npm run init` - install jspm packages and prebuilds vendor.dev.js bundle

`npm run init:deploy` - clone git repository in `/dist` folder (gh-pages branch)
